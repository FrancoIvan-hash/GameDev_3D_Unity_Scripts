MOBILE COURSES DURATION:
- Ball Launcher: 1h 24m       (1h 30m) --> DONE
- Simple Driving: 1h 54m 50s  (2h)     --> IN-PROGRESS
- Asteroid Avoider: 2h 7m 17s (2h 10m)

Project Setup:
- Install 
--> Device Simulator (enable preview in project settings)
--> Input System
- Get Device Simulator from Window > General > Device Simulator
- Enable click to simulate touch by:
--> Window > Analysis > Input Debugger > Options > Simulate Touch Input from Mouse or Pen

BALL LAUNCHER GAME

Key terminology:
- Renderer: allows us to see our sprite / art
- Collider: invisible shape that Unity uses for physics collisions
- RigidBody: allows the object to receive forces and to be influenced by gravity

World and Screen Space
- Screen Space: touch position in terms of pixels on your Screen
- World Space: position in terms of units inside the game World

iOS Dev in MacOS 
- steps to fix Shell Script error in Xcode:
--> terminal command: chmod +x +MapFileParser.sh 
- permissions on iPhone:
--> Settings -> General -> Device Management -> Trust dev app

SIMPLE DRIVING GAME

Guidelines for making a track:
- start with big picture decisions
--> size of the track
--> shape of corners/turns
--> speed and turning vehicle
- loosely block out the shape and layout of your track
- tweak the challenge parts of your track
- make it look nicer more organized

ASTEROID AVOIDER GAME

Spaceship Movement:
- Update vs FixedUpdate
--> Update is called every frame (great for taking input)
--> FixedUpdate is called every time the physics system updates which is less than Update
------> Don't want to do physics update every frame because they are expensive
--> Update's call frequency changes based on how well the game is running
--> FixedUpdate's call frequency stays consistent regardless of the game's performance

Screen Wraparound:
- Viewport Positions
--> (0, 1) top left of screen
--> (0, 0) bottom left of screen
--> (1, 1) top right of screen
--> (1, 0) bottom right of screen
--> (0.5, 0.5) - middle of screen

Spaceship Rotation:
- Quaternion
--> need to learn about Quaternion

Implementing Ads:
- Singletons:
--> Positive:
-----> easily accessible from anywhere
-----> only one instance
--> Negatives:
-----> can't be inherited
-----> can cause many issues if used incorrectly

COMPLETE UNITY 3D DEV COURSES:
- Obstacle Course (DONE)
- Project Boost (DONE)
- Argon Assault (7h 10m 2s) ---> 7h 10m
- Realm Rush (7h 8m 24s)    ---> 7h 10m	
- Zombie Runner (7h 22m 25s)---> 7h 20m

OBSTACLE COURSE
- done

PROJECT BOOST

Basic Input Binding:
- ctrl + shift + space: get signature options for a class

Using AddRelativeForce():
- add force relative to game object

Transform.Rotate() Our Rocket:
- ctrl + . : Extract Method
---> creates a method (asks for name) when highlighting over a piece of code in VS Code (press keys above)

Our Source Control Repo:
- Some terminology:
---> Source Control: a system for tracking and managing changes to your code
---> Git: a type of version control system that tracks changes to files
---> Gitlab (also, GitHub): repository hosting service
---> Repository (Repo): directory or storage space for your project
---> SourceTree: desktop client to help view your repo

Unity Audio Introduction:
- 3 Main things we need
---> Audio Listener: to hear the audio
------> Audio Source: to play the audio
---------> Audio File: the sounds that get played
- Main camera: default audio listener
- audio source is attached to game object that generates a sound

Play AudioSource SFX:
- AudioSource: type -> Audio Source
---> AudioSource audioSource: audioSource.Play() --> fine if it's only one clip attached to Audio Source

Respawn Using SceneManager:
- Get current scene index (integer value): SceneManager.GetActiveScene().buildIndex
- load/reload a scene: SceneManager.LoadScene(sceneIndexInt or sceneNameString)
---> nameof(MethodName): use this function instead of using a string to Invoke a method

Load Next Level:
- SceneManager.sceneCountInBuildSettings: returns the total number of scenes in your world

Multiple Audio Clips:
- AudioSource.PlayOneShot(AudioClip clip, float volumeScale)
---> this function lets you play a specific sound when you have multiple attached to an audio source

How to add lights in Unity:
- Main Directional Light: Sun
- Environment Lighting
- Scene Lights
---> Spotlights
------> light is only in one direction
---> Pointlights
------> kind of light a lamp light

Move Obstacle with Code:
- [SerializeField] [Range(0,1)] float movementFactor;
---> makes it available in the editor, and makes it a slider

Mathf.Sin() For Oscillation:
- tau = 2*PI
- period = 2
- cycle = Time * time / period

Protect Against NaN Error:
- might cause errors when playing the game
- avoid by using:
---> return if period == 0: but floating point comparison might not be exact
---> Mathf.Epsilon: the smallest floating point number

Designing Level Moments:
- Useful Game Design Approach:
---> Design "moments" and then expand them into a level. Moments that use the environment:
------> Fly under
------> Fly over
------> Fly through a gap
------> Time your flight through moving obstacle
------> Land on moving platform
------> Fly through narrow tunnel
---> Moments that use tuning of our existing game:
------> slower rocket (it got damaged)
------> faster rocket (got a boost)
------> darker level
------> closer camera
------> bigger rocket (carrying something)
------> reversed controls

ARGON ASSAULT

Argon Assault Game Design:
- Player Experience:
--- chaos
- Core Mechanic:
---> dodge and shoot
- Core game loop:
---> get as far as possible without dying in order to get the highest score possible
---> start over when dying

Game Theme:
- you must save your planet, Argon, from destruction by an invading force

Features - in priority
- camera rail
---> path through the level that the camera follows
- player movement
---> horizontal and vertical movement
- health
---> enemies have health that depletes when shot
- enemy paths
---> enemies should travel on paths and be hand placed by the designer
- score
---> points are given for killing enemies
- game loop
---> upon dying, player restarts the level

Other features you can consider
- multiple levels
---> finish a level and load the next
- player shield
---> when damaged, the player's shield depletes
- pickups 
---> flying over a shield pickup will increase the player's shields
- momentary invulnerability
---> after taking damage, the player cannot take damage gain for X time
- weapon upgrades
---> flying over a pickup could increase weapon damage

How to add Terrain
- keys for terrain
---> [ decrease brush size
---> ] increase brush size
- opacity: how much terrain is raised

Texturing Terrain in Unity
- Paint texture
---> layers
------> add layers
- Bump Map
---> texture with information on how light catches a shape
- Height map
---> uses white-to-black scale to show height
- Normal map
---> uses RGB values to indicate x, y, z facing direction (for light)

Master Timeline For Player Rail
- Window >> Sequencing >> Timeline
- Window >> Animation
- Create Empty Game Object (Master Timeline)
---> select it and click on create button in Timeline window
- On Master Timeline (Timeline window)
---> on left side, click on the + icon (top left) and add an Animation Track
---> key frame (just move gameObject up and down a bit to create it at the start)
---> move to desired next stop using RMB and WASD and press ctrl+shift+F (align with view)
-----> make sure you align with view while selecting gameObject

Animate Enemy Using Timeline
- use curves to change rotation or position of the animated game object

Using GetAxis() For Movement
- Input Manager: old input system
- Input System: new input system

Mathf.Clamp() To Constraint Movement:
- Params: (value, min, max)
- SHORTCUT: F2 to rename a highlighted variable (will change name every variable)

How To Set Local Position
- Roll axis
---> rotate z-axis
---> looks like it's moving to the right or left
- Pitch axis
---> rotate x-axis
---> looks like it's going up or down
- Yaw axis
---> rotate y-axis
---> pointing its nose to the right or left
- rotate y-axis before rotating another axis so that the other values aren't affected
- Quaternion.Euler(x, y, z)
---> (pitch, yaw, roll)
